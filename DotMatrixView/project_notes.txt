Project notes
=============

NEXT: Write the code to create the dots off and dots on collections for a transition from one digit to another.
	  Optimise the code so that it finds both off and on dots in a single pass.
	  Use the on and off dots to set off animations.

Add feature to change from one digit to another by transition. Need code that compares
the currently lit and need to be lit dots to make 2 lists:
1) dots that need to be turned off
2) dots that need to be turned on
Or forget the lists, just [make the changes/set the animations off] as they are calculated?
	
The alpha transition makes the spots disappear right down to the background.
	Change it to not go all the way down to zero - it might look passable.
	Make a 3.0-style property animation that takes the colour down to the dim colour.
	Do the shadow properties work on shape drawables?
	
Learn how to target multiple SDK levels so I can optionally use view or property animation.

Make the digits build in code with arbitrary sizes:
	build the original matrices
	build the co-ordinates of the digit parts, spacers and colon
	arguments for building a matrix:
		dots wide
		dots high
		dot size
		spacer width
	
	Should this actually just construct a matrix big enough for the full display, with the
	digits being indexes to items within it?
	
Try building a ShapeDrawable using a Path. The point of the experiment is to see if you can
change the fill colour of such a drawable dynamically, and if so, if the colour can be the
subject of a property animation.

	21,27,
	28,34,
	35,41,
