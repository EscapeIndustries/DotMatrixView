Project notes
=============

NEXT: Use DigitDisplay to set the 1st digit to 1 and the others to 0.
 	
Make it possible to set a digit to an individual value (1,2,3...)
Thoughts:
	Make lists of dot references for a digit. A reference is the position if you flattened all the rows into a single array.
	Write code to turn on all the dots in a collection
	Write code to turn off all the dots in a collection
		That is the same code except for the condition
	Code to filter down the dots that need to change, based on remembering the current digit.
	I need an array (one item per digit) of Lists
	
The alpha transition makes the spots disappear right down to the background.
	Change it to not go all the way down to zero - it might look passable.
	Make a 3.0-style property animation that takes the colour down to the dim colour.
	Do the shadow properties work on shape drawables?
