Project notes
=============

NEXT: Try to make the digits smaller so they don't need massive screens to work.
 	
Add feature to change from one digit to another by transition. Need code that compares
the currently lit and need to be lit dots to make 2 lists:
1) dots that need to be turned off
2) dots that need to be turned on
Or forget the lists, just [make the changes/set the animations off] as they are calculated?
	
The alpha transition makes the spots disappear right down to the background.
	Change it to not go all the way down to zero - it might look passable.
	Make a 3.0-style property animation that takes the colour down to the dim colour.
	Do the shadow properties work on shape drawables?
	
Learn how to target multiple SDK levels so I can optionally use view or property animation.
	
An eight - all elements on - looks like this:
	1,2,3,4,5,
	7,13,
	14,20,
	21,27,
	28,34,
	35,41,
	43,44,45,46,47,
	49,55,
	56,62,
	63,69,
	70,76,
	77,83,
	85,86,87,88,89
