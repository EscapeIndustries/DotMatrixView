Project notes
=============

NEXT: Use the on and off dots to set off animations.
		Goal 1: Get the activity to change 1 to 2 when it loads.
			What are the pieces?
		[ ]		NumericalDisplayActivity should kick off the animation
		[ ]		DigitDisplay is in control
		[X]		DigitTransition provides the items to work on
				Where do the ImageView references come from?
		[X]			DigitDisplay should have the method getDot(int index)
		Goal 2: Use an animation listener to make it count up in a loop.

Add feature to change from one digit to another by transition. Need code that compares
the currently lit and need to be lit dots to make 2 lists:
1) dots that need to be turned off
2) dots that need to be turned on
Or forget the lists, just [make the changes/set the animations off] as they are calculated?
	
The alpha transition makes the spots disappear right down to the background.
	Change it to not go all the way down to zero - it might look passable.
	Make a 3.0-style property animation that takes the colour down to the dim colour.
	Do the shadow properties work on shape drawables?
	
Learn how to target multiple SDK levels so I can optionally use view or property animation.

Make the digits build in code with arbitrary sizes:
	build the original matrices
	build the co-ordinates of the digit parts, spacers and colon
	arguments for building a matrix:
		dots wide
		dots high
		dot size
		spacer width
	
	Should this actually just construct a matrix big enough for the full display, with the
	digits being indexes to items within it?
	
Try building a ShapeDrawable using a Path. The point of the experiment is to see if you can
change the fill colour of such a drawable dynamically, and if so, if the colour can be the
subject of a property animation.
